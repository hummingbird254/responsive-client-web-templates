		<span class="text-title">Capacity Building</span>
		<div class="text-content">
		<p>Capacity building is fundamentally about improving effectiveness at the organizational level. Nonprofit organizations are justly admired for their passionate commitment to mission and their inventive approaches to addressing urgent social problems. Around the world, nonprofits are implementing programs that are improving the quality of life for tens of millions of people, and they are often doing so against extreme odds and with very limited resources. The success that nonprofits have demonstrated in addressing social issues has generated increased demand for their services. Government is increasingly turning to nonprofits as potential service providers and partners in tackling our most pressing social issues. We now recognize that most of these issues – such as hunger, homelessness, or environmental conservation – will not be “solved” in our lifetime, and therefore will require strong organizations to continue to address them. Nonprofits have an obligation to seek new and ever more effective ways of making tangible progress toward their missions, and this requires building organizational capacity. All too many nonprofits, however, focus on creating new programs and keeping administrative costs low instead of building the organizational capacity necessary to achieve their aspirations effectively and efficiently. This is not surprising, given that donors and funders have traditionally been more interested in supporting an exciting new idea than in building an organization that can effectively carry out that idea. This must change; both nonprofit managers and those that fund them must recognize that excellence in programmatic innovation and implementation are insufficient for nonprofits to achieve lasting results. Great programs need great organizations behind them. As we normally say, the only way to build a great organization is to build capacity.</p>

		<p>If building capacity is vital to the long-term health and effectiveness of nonprofit institutions, both large and small, how then can we determine the capacity gaps of a particular nonprofit? Are there common threads, common issues, and a common framework for assessing capacity that cut across the full spectrum of nonprofit activity? Capacity is one of those words that mean all things to all people, and nonprofits have approached and interpreted capacity building in many different ways. As a starting point, therefore, the team uses a “Capacity Framework” to provide a common vision and vocabulary for nonprofit capacity. The Capacity Framework defines nonprofit capacity in a pyramid of seven essential elements: three higher-level elements – aspirations, strategy, and organizational skills – three foundational elements – systems and infrastructure, human resources, and organizational structure – and a cultural element which serves to connect all the others. The team defined these elements as follows:

			<ul>
				<li>Aspirations: An organization’s mission, vision, and overarching goals, which collectively articulate its common sense of purpose and direction.</li>
				<li>Strategy: The coherent set of actions and programs aimed at fulfilling the organization’s overarching goals.</li>
				<li>Organizational Skills: The sum of the organization’s capabilities, including such things (among others) as performance measurement, planning, resource management, and external relationship building.</li>
				<li>Human Resources: The collective capabilities, experiences, potential and commitment of the organization’s board, management team, staff, and volunteers.</li>
				<li>Systems and Infrastructure: The organization’s planning, decision making, knowledge management, and administrative systems, as well as the physical and technological assets that support the organization.</li>
				<li>Organizational Structure: The combination of governance, organizational design, inter-functional coordination, and individual job descriptions that shapes the organization’s legal and management structure.</li>
				<li>Culture: The connective tissue that binds together the organization, including shared values and practices, behavior norms, and most important, the organization’s orientation towards performance. By combining all the different elements of organizational capacity in a single, coherent diagram, the pyramid emphasizes the importance of examining each element both individually and in relation to the other elements, as well as in context of the whole enterprise. These emphases reflect a key finding of the research: many nonprofits tend to think capacity building is limited to “technical assistance” or improving the effectiveness of functions at the bottom of the pyramid – human resources or organizational structure, for example. In fact, the case studies suggest that the greatest gains in social impact came when organizations engaged in capacity building efforts that were aligned within the pyramid.</li>
			</ul>

		<span class="text-title">Community Capacity Building</span>
		<div class="text-content">
		<p>The Community Capacity Building component assists groups by enhancing skills essential to regional economic planning, development and implementation. The component offers capacity building modules, planning sessions, and industry development sessions to interested stakeholders with a clear link to economic and business development.</p>

		<p>The objectives are:

			<ul>
				<li>To enable community-based economic development organizations to assume the role of partners in regional economic development.</li>
				<li>To deliver a comprehensive orientation program designed to help build and shape communities.</li>
				<li>To encourage collaboration and broad-based partnerships.</li>
			</ul>

		</p>
		
		</div>


		<span class="text-title">Advocacy</span>
		<div class="text-content">

		<p>

			<ul>
				<li>Advocacy is a targeted process of influencing holders of power to arrive at decisions or policies and laws that benefit the poor, vulnerable and marginalized. (Kenyan Civil Society Strengthening Program Working Definition)</li>
				<li>A deliberate process of influencing those who make decisions about developing, changing and implementing policies.</li>
				<li>Influencing – targets decision makers; decision makers are those who have the ability to legislate, negotiate or set budgets relating to formal public policies.</li>
				<li>Decision makers may not be the same as power holders – decisions can be heavily influenced by those who hold formal and informal power in society including business, the media, religious leaders and social movements amongst others.</li>
				<li>Developing, changing and implementing policies – policies can be outdated, hostile or non-existent, and as such, some change to them is required.</li>
